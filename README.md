# paper-wallet

Paper wallet is a custom Bitcoin wallet generation ready for printing directly from your browser.

A safer way would be to download and use it from your computer while being offline along with [bitaddress.org](https://www.bitaddress.org/)

## Dependencies

The project's dependencies are very limited and quite safe for the generation of your personal paper wallets.
* jQuery 3.5.1
* qrcode.js

## Long Term Storage

I'm storing some BTC longterm, so I wanted to find a way to protect my wallets over time.

I stack the printed wallets with blank paper between each paper.
This hides the private from being shown when under sunlight.

eg. top of the stack -> **Public** + blank + **Private** + blank <- back of the stack

Water protection is a must for a long term wallet.
So I laminate the whole stack or I put the stack inside a plastic sheet protector and seal it with heat.

I'm also printing everything twice in order to avoid possible loss of the paper wallets.
