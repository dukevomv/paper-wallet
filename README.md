# paper-wallet

Paper wallet is a custom Bitcoin wallet generation ready for printing directly from your browser.

A safer way would be to download and use it from your computer while being offline along with [bitaddress.org](https://www.bitaddress.org/)

# Dependencies

The project's dependencies are very limited and quite safe for the generation of your personal paper wallets.
* jQuery 3.5.1
* qrcode.js
